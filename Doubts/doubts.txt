bigger picture about pd-ros.

how is cutomer going to check the privacy and why is he cheking in the first place??


ROS2??


in SROS , TLS is being used , so how is it being used?
does each application get it's own keys? and each application is signed by a trusted authotriy.
do they exchange the certificates for communication between the applications??


in the context switches part , we can see 0 as no.of context switches.so does that mean the normal OS and Trusted OS have 
same privilege levels even though memory accessible is different??


for calculating the hash of a larger file , do we need to use the shared memory and then send the data in chunks
or should we work directly on the physical memory?
