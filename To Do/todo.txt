try to vary the file size from 1-4 MB chunks and observe the overall latency and per IPC latency.


read and understand the kernel attestation.

add clear metrics in the results produced by the performance stats.(like adding total overhead and overhead per IPC ).

try to collect data from multiple file sizes and multiple chunk sizes and do analysis on it.


make documentation even more clearer.



and add the perf tool for performance measurement.



go through this:
https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/3.13.0/debug/benchmark.html




build the OPTEE by linking openssl to the TA

update the calculations in the ta.c  like the number of hash opertaions , secure storage accesse etc..
and try to see by removing all the debug print statements.
