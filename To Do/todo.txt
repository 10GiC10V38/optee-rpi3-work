try to vary the file size from 1-4 MB chunks and observe the overall latency and per IPC latency.


read and understand the kernel attestation.

add clear metrics in the results produced by the performance stats.(like adding total overhead and overhead per IPC ).

try to collect data from multiple file sizes and multiple chunk sizes and do analysis on it.


make documentation even more clearer.







go through this:
https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/3.13.0/debug/benchmark.html



current:

add the perf tool for performance measurement.
build the OPTEE by linking openssl to the TA
update the calculations in the ta.c  like the number of hash opertaions , secure storage accesses etc..
and try to see by removing all the debug print statements.
try and use ARM cycle counters and also see about the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) in rpi3 and how that can be used in normal os and secure os.
need to finalize how hash operations are to be calculated.

memory utilization
cpu utilization
stack utilization

observe exact memory addresses which are accessed or which memory region is getting accessed.
